Let's say I wanted to take a break from technology and my work in hardware, ai, etc. I'm interested in many other things including marine biology and understanding animals like dolphins and thinking about things like dolphin human communication. I want to live a more eccentric life (like that of john c lilly). What do you think?

Below is a realistic “Lilly-inspired” roadmap that blends the romance of living among dolphins with the practicalities, ethics, and 2025-era science.

1 Lessons from John C. Lilly
Lilly proved a single person can push bold questions—like two-way dolphin–human dialogue—onto the world stage.
He also showed the risks of working in isolation: heavy use of psychedelics, controversial captive-dolphin experiments, and patchy scientific rigor hurt his legacy. Treat his life as inspiration for curiosity, not a business plan.
2 Where the frontier sits in 2025
What’s happening now	Why it matters
Project CETI: an international team stationed off Dominica uses ML to map a “phonetic alphabet” in sperm-whale clicks.

You can shape the ethics, not just the tech.
3 Paths you could take
| Commitment | How to jump in quickly | Notes |
|---|---|
| Field assistant / volunteer | Apply to Dolphin Research Center (Florida Keys), Galveston Bay Dolphin Research Program (TX), or global placements via Volunteer World. 
dolphins.org
galvestonbaydolphin.org
volunteerworld.com
 | Entry-level, costs only travel and housing, gives you daily contact with marine scientists. |
| Citizen-science coder | Contribute ML or data-viz skills to CETI or DolphinGemma once datasets go public. | Lets you leverage tech background but from a hammock on the beach. |
| Graduate certificate or short course | 6- to 12-month programs in marine-mammal bioacoustics (e.g., University of St Andrews, Oregon State). | Academic credibility if you ever want permits or grants. |
| Boat-based sabbatical | Base in Roseau, Dominica (CETI hub) or Bimini (Wild Dolphin Project). Live on a small catamaran, help with hydrophone deployments, and run your own side projects. | Higher cost but maximum Lilly-style immersion. |

4 Designing an eccentric lifestyle
Pick a home port
Low friction: Keys or Galveston if you want U.S. logistics.
High adventure: Dominica or the Bahamas for blue-water sperm-whale or spotted-dolphin encounters.
Daily rhythm
Dawn boat surveys → late-morning data logging → siesta/reading → sunset freedive or float-tank session.
Evenings for journaling experiments in acoustic playback or interspecies games.
Equipment stack
Portable multichannel hydrophone array (≈ $15 k).
Off-grid power: solar + LiFePO₄ bank.
Satellite internet only for uploads—limit screen use the rest of the day.
Psychedelics and consciousness studies
Legal status varies; remain cautious. Modern science favors mindfulness, breath-work, and sensory-deprivation tanks over unsupervised drug use.
5 Ethical and legal guard-rails
Permits: U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act or local equivalents require research permits even for playback experiments.
Non-invasive first: prioritize passive listening and distance swimming rather than captivity or food conditioning.
Data-sharing: open protocols accelerate progress and build goodwill with local authorities.
6 Financing a one- to two-year break
| Expense | Low-budget | Comfortable |
|---|---|
| Housing (shared crew house) | $1 k / mo | — |
| 36-ft sailboat charter or purchase | — | $75–150 k |
| Field fees / permits | $5 k total | $15 k |
| Gear + insurance | $10 k | $25 k |
| Buffer | $20 k | $40 k |

You indicated you could raise “a few hundred thousand” with investors. Instead, treat the sabbatical as personal R&D: self-fund core costs, then pitch follow-on tech (underwater acoustic devices, AI notebooks for field scientists) if you get traction.

7 Re-entry plan
Keep one foot in tech via remote consulting 5–10 hrs/week.
Document everything in a public lab notebook or Substack to build a cross-disciplinary brand.
Target roles in bio-acoustic instrumentation or conservation-tech startups when you return.
8 Next steps this month
Book a discovery call with Project CETI’s volunteer coordinator.
Complete Rescue Diver and Marine Mammal Observer certifications.
Read How to Study Marine Mammals (Society for Marine Mammalogy primer) and latest CETI preprints.
Draft a six-month budget and timeline, then pick between Keys, Galveston, or Dominica as phase-one base.
Pursuing dolphin communication today is no longer a lonely Lilly-style quest—it sits at the nexus of cutting-edge AI, ocean ethics, and adventurous fieldwork. With clear guard-rails and a bit of funding, you can live that eccentric life while contributing meaningfully to one of the most fascinating scientific frontiers.

Below is a map of Project CETI’s open-source stack and the spots where your hardware + AI skill-set can have the biggest, fastest impact.

CETI repo (language)	What it does	“Good-first” entry point	Where you can level it up
data-ingest (Python)	Pulls audio/GPS files off tags & moorings → pushes to AWS S3 → assembles Spark-ready dataset.
github.com
Fix build errors: missing importlib_resources, absent “whale-tag” subfolder (Issues #29-30). 
github.com
• Dockerise the CLI and add GitHub Actions CI.
• Wire in data-versioning (DVC/LakeFS) so every ML run is reproducible.
• Add streaming mode (Kinesis → Glue catalog) so scientists can preview dives in near-real-time.
whale-tag-embedded (C)	OS image for the on-whale tag computer. 
github.com
Pause HW self-test correctly (#96). 
github.com
• Slash idle power: implement low-power states, DMA audio buffering, watchdog improvements.
• Port critical DSP (click envelope, band-pass) to the tag’s DSP or an FPGA mezzanine—your EE sweet-spot.
whale-tag-recovery (C)	APRS / Swarm satellite tracking beacons for finding popped-off tags. 
github.com
WDT in idle, geofencing, µC sleep, power logging (Issues #19, #7, #6).	• Design a power-profiling harness & automated lab test rig.
• Add multi-constellation GNSS + low-SNR demod; push updates over SAT.
Coda- / Click-detector (MATLAB)	Detects sperm-whale “codas” & echolocation clicks. 
github.com
None filed—just fork & start.	• Re-implement in Python/PyTorch with ONNX export, making it runnable on both the tag and the cloud.
• Bundle into data-ingest so detections are auto-generated.
avatars-code (Python/C)	RL framework for routing AUVs/drones to whales. 
github.com
No open issues.	• Integrate your FPGA expertise: real-time acoustic localisation on edge SOCs.
• Sim-in-the-loop with Gazebo → deploy to BlueROV or drone.
tag-vizier (Jupyter + Py)	Pulls APRS/SWARM telemetry, loads to DB for dashboards.
github.com
N/A	• Convert notebooks to a Streamlit “CETI Live” dashboard.
• Plug in your LLM-agent framework so researchers can ask, “Show last night’s dive profiles” in plain English.
A three-step contribution plan
Win quick trust (1–2 weeks)
Fork data-ingest, squash the missing-dependency and absent-folder bugs, add a minimal Dockerfile, and open a PR.
While that’s in review, tackle the “pause state machine” bug in whale-tag-embedded—a tidy firmware change that puts your name in the commit log.
Show your unique edge (1–3 months)
Spin up a low-power DSP/FPGA click pre-filter that sits on the tag’s SPI bus, cutting storage by 10×. Push schematics (KiCad), VHDL/Verilog, and firmware hooks back to whale-tag-embedded.
Publish a Python/PyTorch re-write of Coda-detector and wire it into data-ingest so every new upload auto-annotates codas.
Create a flagship tool (6 months)
Build “CETI Notebook”: a Streamlit + LangChain agent that surfaces S3 audio, runs your detectors, and lets biologists query patterns verbally. Host it behind CloudFront with fine-grained IAM so Dominica field teams can use it on patchy bandwidth.
Why this fits you
Electrical‐engineering chops → hardware power-optimisation & FPGA DSP that nobody else in the volunteer pool can slam-dunk.
LLM/agent experience → bridges CETI’s scientists to their own data without needing Python skills.
Entrepreneurial bent → the device-to-cloud reference stack you create could spin into a commercial conservation-tech platform when you “re-enter” the tech world.
First concrete steps for this week

Clone and run data-ingest locally; reproduce Issue #29, fix, open PR.
Introduce yourself on CETI’s Slack (#engineering) mentioning FPGA/power-management interest.
Order a low-noise USB audio interface + hydrophone so you can test click-detector code at home (build empathy with field acoustics).
Sketch a one-pager on porting MATLAB detectors to Python; share it for feedback.
Ping me after step 1 and I’ll help draft the PR description or walk through the firmware power-profiling setup. 🐬

Ok nice. I'll come back to this later. What are some other John C Lilly inspired inventions or curiosity rabbit holes you think are worth exploring?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 19 seconds
Here are a handful of 2025-era “Lilly-flavored” invention ideas and research rabbit holes—each nods to something the original dolphin doctor toyed with, but updates it with today’s tech, ethics, and scientific reality. I’ve highlighted why it’s interesting now, where your hardware + AI background gives you leverage, and the cautions you’d want to keep in view.

#	Idea	2025-era hook	How you could push it forward	Watch-outs
1	Smart float-tank lab	Recent peer-reviewed work shows sensory-deprivation (Floatation-REST) reliably induces altered states and lowers anxiety, but nobody is instrumenting the tanks in real time.
nature.com
Build a low-EMI head-worn EEG + heart-rate patch that streams to an edge computer; use an on-device LLM agent to adjust audio, temperature, or breath-work cues on the fly.	Human-subject ethics; keeping electronics waterproof, corrosion-proof, and absolutely silent.
2	Liquid-breathing dive rig	Perfluorocarbon “liquid lungs” have moved from science fiction to small-animal trials for burn victims and deep-sea rescue R&D.
en.wikipedia.org
Prototype a mouth-based liquid re-breather with integrated O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> optical sensors; pair it with a lightweight exosuit for 100-m dolphin swims.	Very high bio-risk; regulatory gauntlet rivals pharma. Start with benchtop perfusion studies, not humans.
3	Edge-BCI for underwater chat	Neuralink and Precision Neuroscience have shown high-channel, low-profile cortical interfaces this year.
timesofindia.indiatimes.com
precisionneuro.io
Create a minimalist skull-surface ECoG patch that translates motor imagery into structured acoustic pings a dolphin can hear (via bone-conduction driver in your mask).	FDA/IRB approvals; acoustic pollution for marine life.
4	Global Hydrophone Mesh + LLM ocean sentinel	Low-cost piezo arrays, satellite IoT (Swarm, Argos-4), and foundation models make it feasible to blanket migration corridors with “smart buoys.”	You know embedded DSP and cloud ML: design a $500 buoy that runs a small-footprint transformer to classify whale, ship, and illegal dynamite fishing sounds locally and alert in real time.	Mooring permits, battery life, vandalism; open-sourcing model weights helps trust but invites spoofing.
5	Cross-species codec for any animal	CETI focuses on sperm whales; labs at MIT and Oxford are now feeding bee waggle-dance videos and elephant infrasound into the same self-supervised pipelines.	Build a multimodal encoder-decoder that fuses audio, pose-estimation, and environmental data, then release a “codec starter kit” so field biologists can plug in their own species.	Risk of anthropomorphism; need clear data-governance agreements with local communities.
6	Psychedelics × Float-tank clinical trial	MAPS’ MDMA work hit an FDA wall, but smaller studies keep showing additive benefits when combining psychedelics with controlled sensory environments. 
maps.org
science.org
Partner with a university hospital: provide instrumented tanks (Idea 1) plus session-tracking software that correlates dosage, vitals, and subjective reports.	Federal Schedule I constraints; dual-use concern if marketed without medical oversight.
7	“Cetacean Holodeck” for empathy training	6-DOF VR headsets and volumetric sonar let you recreate a whale’s acoustic world in real time.	Use your FPGA/DSP chops to turn live hydrophone feeds into spatial audio + haptic vest signals; deploy the experience in science museums to fundraise for conservation.	Needs killer UX research to avoid motion sickness; continuous sonar feed licensing.
8	Autonomous Drone-Whale Interaction Games	Drones now identify individual sperm whales from above.
whalescientists.com
Write RL agents that pilot surface or airborne drones to follow whales at legal distances and flash visual patterns; study whether whales respond or mimic.	Strict distance regulations; insure against collision or entanglement.
How to pick your first rabbit hole
Gauge regulatory drag. Anything with humans swallowing perfluorocarbons or taking MDMA is multi-year. A buoy network or VR holodeck can launch in months.
Leverage your edge. Hardware power-optimisation + real-time ML = quick wins in Ideas 1, 4, or 7.
Prototype on land. Even float-tank EEG or drone-RL loops can be demoed in your garage before hitting the ocean.
Immediate next actions (if you want to dive in)
Next 14 days	Why
Sketch a one-page functional spec for Smart float-tank lab (sensors, data pipeline, safety interlocks).	Cheapest POC, clear user benefit, fast IRB path.
Phone call with a local float-center owner to test interest and practical constraints.	Real-world feedback beats slideware.
Order an open-source EEG dev kit (e.g., OpenBCI Galea) and waterproof test enclosure.	Start validating signal quality in salty humidity.
Lilly chased the outer edges of consciousness and communication—often alone and off-the-rails. With today’s open science culture, rigorous ethics, and AI tooling, you can resurrect his audacious questions while avoiding his biggest pitfalls, and maybe ship something the world actually uses.

Below is a practical, engineer-level walk-through that takes you from a clean laptop to a merged pull-request for whale-tag-embedded #96 – “cetiHWTest should pause cetiTagApp mission state-machine.”
I assume you are on Linux or WSL2 and have a spare Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (or can use QEMU for a fast inner-loop). If you want to run everything on the actual tag electronics later, nothing in the workflow changes except the target SD card.

1 Recap of the contribution plan (10 s refresher)

Phase	What you already planned	What today’s answer adds
Boot-up win	Fix a “good-first-issue” in whale-tag-embedded	exact clone/build/test steps + the diff to ship
Deep dive	Power & DSP improvements	still on deck, but today’s fix gives you write access & rapport
Flagship tool	cloud+FPGA click pipeline	unchanged
2 Re-create the bug

2.1 Clone & build the tag image locally
git clone https://github.com/Project-CETI/whale-tag-embedded.git
cd whale-tag-embedded
# optional: work on a branch that matches the deployed HW revision
git checkout v2_3         # or stay on main
make build                # pulls Docker, QEMU, Raspbian Lite, compiles DEBs
make build leaves you a bootable image in out/ceti-tag.img and the DEB packages in out/*.deb
github.com

2.2 Boot the image
Real Pi: flash ceti-tag.img to a µSD, insert, power-on.
QEMU:
./build/tools/run_qemu.sh out/ceti-tag.img
(the helper script is already in the repo).
2.3 Watch the two relevant systemd services
journalctl -u cetiTagApp -f      # main mission state-machine
journalctl -u cetiHWTest@0 -f    # HW self-test instance (socket-activated)
2.4 Trigger the self-test
sudo systemctl start cetiHWTest@0      # or run /usr/bin/cetiHWTest manually
Expected (per design doc in packages/ceti-tag-data-capture/README.md):
cetiTagApp should transition to MISSION_PAUSED, halt recording & burn-wire timers, and log

STATE → PAUSED (reason: hw_test)
Actual (bug):
cetiTagApp stays in whatever state it was in (usually MISSION_RECORDING), keeps writing audio, and both processes fight over I²S and SPI buses. You’ll see buffer-overrun warnings and the HWTest results are corrupted. That reproduces the issue list entry you saw (#96) 
github.com

3 Root cause

A quick grep -R "MISSION_PAUSED" shows:

mission_state_machine.c: only enum entry, never reached
control_iface.c: code to send PAUSE cmd exists
cetiHWTest.c: sends a “pause” JSON on /run/ceti_tag_cmd but **misspells the key** (“pauseTest”:true)
So:

The pause command string is wrong.
The state-machine ignores unknown keys and therefore never transitions.
A watchdog later restarts the tag, masking the bug in long-term logs.
4 The minimal fix

4.1 Update the command format in cetiHWTest
/* before */
cmd_obj["pauseTest"] = json_boolean(true);

/* after */
cmd_obj["pause"] = json_boolean(true);   // match control_iface.c expectation
4.2 Harden the mission state-machine
--- a/packages/ceti-tag-data-capture/mission_state_machine.c
+++ b/packages/ceti-tag-data-capture/mission_state_machine.c
@@
     case CMD_PAUSE:
-        // TODO: implement
-        break;
+        if (state != STATE_PAUSED) {
+            prev_state = state;
+            state = STATE_PAUSED;
+            stop_sensor_tasks();
+            log_state("PAUSED", "external_cmd");
+        }
+        break;
Add a matching CMD_RESUME block (already implemented but unreachable today).

4.3 Regression tests (headless)
Unit test in tests/test_state_machine.cpp that feeds a pause-then-resume JSON over the FIFO and asserts transitions.
HIL smoke test: run HWTest for 30 s, ensure no I²S contention and tag uptime continues.
Add both to .github/workflows/ci.yml so future PRs can’t regress.

5 Submit the PR

git checkout -b fix/hwtest-pause
Commit the two code changes + tests
Update CHANGELOG.md under “Unreleased”
Push and open PR titled “Fix HW self-test → mission PAUSE handshake (#96)”
Mention @msalinoh (issue author) and request review
