# CETI Tag Configuration
# 
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Depth Thresholds P1 and P2
# If pressure < P1, device is considered at the surface
# If pressure > P2, device is considered submerged
# Between P1 and P2 is a hysteresis band
# The state machine uses this information to turn the GPS and/or
# the XBEE radio on and off depending on the phase of the deployment
# Units are bar absolute with reference value of 1 bar (absolute) abs
# See Keller 4LD...9LD data sheet
#
P1=0.04
P2=0.10

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Battery Thresholds V1 and V2
# This is used as a barebones method to determine state of charge
# Gas gauge has more sophisticated feature available
# This is just to get started with
# V1 - battery is low, time to release from the whale!
# V2 - battery is critical, time to put the system to sleep
# Units are volts
#
V1=6.4
V2=6.2
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Deployment Timeout
# Indepedent of battery state of charge, if deployment
# time reaches this value, the tag will release
# The battery thresholds take precedence
# Units are minutes, use integers only
# 240
T0=240
